# {} hashnode-sdk-js

Hashnode SDK for JavaScript/TypeScript (unofficial).

## What is this?

This is JavaScript/TypeScript library for working with Hashnode
programmatically, it's built around [Hashnode API].

### Key concepts

- Opinionated, has its own interfaces focusing on common blogging features, e.g.
  CRUD articles, comments, etc (_what you usually do on Hashnode_).

- Abstracts away Hashnode API, which is currently in alpha and subject to
  breaking changes in the future. You can assume this SDK will quickly adapt to
  Hashnode API's changes and keep functioning.

- **Not** flexible, you can't query less or more fields, these are provided by
  Hashnode GraphQL API already.

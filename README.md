# 📦 hashnode-sdk-js

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/hashnode-sdk-js)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hashnode-sdk-js)
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/phuctm97/hashnode-sdk-js)](/LICENSE)

Hashnode SDK for JavaScript/TypeScript (unofficial).

## What is this?

This is a library for working with [Hashnode] programmatically in
JavaScript/TypeScript, it's built around [Hashnode API].

### Key concepts

- Opinionated, has its own interfaces focusing on common blogging features, e.g.
  CRUD articles, comments, etc (_what you usually do on Hashnode_).

- Abstracts away Hashnode API, which is currently in alpha and subject to
  breaking changes. Whereas, this SDK's API is **considerably stable**, its API
  won't change without a major release. As soon as Hashnode API changes, it will
  be updated to keep its API remain unchanged and function correctly.

- **Not** flexible by design, you can't query less or more fields, these use
  cases are covered by Hashnode GraphQL API.

### How & why?

I ([@phuctm97]) is actively using this SDK in [my website] to implement an
[auto-crosspost workflow], which runs daily. Hence, as soon as something breaks,
I'll recognize and fix as soon as possible. Check out [this workflow run] to see
how it is used in practice.

## Usage

```bash
yarn add hashnode-sdk-js
```

### API

#### Configure API key

Go to Hashnode account settings, create an API key and set it as environment
variable `HASHNODE_API_KEY` at where you run your application, the SDK will
automatically use it.

import hashnode from "hashnode-sdk-js";

hashnode.findUser("phuctm97").then((data) => console.log(data));
